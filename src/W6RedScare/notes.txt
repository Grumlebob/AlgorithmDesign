/*
Short version of the problem:

Unweighted
Both directed and undirected
No parallel edges

simple path: no repeated vertices (så ex, kan man ikke lave et spanning tree, og blot vandrer frem og tilbage og ramme alle vertices)


Always has start and end vertices (Can also be red)


Data format:
n m r       //n vertices, m edges, r red vertices
s t         //start and end vertices
<vertices>
black: BOB
red: BOB *
<edges>
undirected: u -- v
directed: u -> v

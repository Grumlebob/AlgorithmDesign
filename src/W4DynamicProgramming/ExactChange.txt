1.4 Explanation of our accepted solution
To solve this assignment, we have used dynamic programming, with a bottomup
approach.
Subproblems: Best amount of moves to hit target x
Base case: How many cards to use, to hit a target of zero = 0.
Memoization: Save the best amount of moves to hit every target x in our
memoized array[x].
Recursive step: Check moves to hit target x+1, with the different cards available,
compared to what we have memoized already, until we reach the desired
target.
Bottom-up approach: We start by checking best amount of moves to hit
0 and then increment by 1 every time, until we reached the top, being our desired
target to hit. Lets say we are currently looking for best move to hit target
19, and we are currently looking at card 5. Then we can check our best way to
hit 19−5 = 14 and see if we can take 1 additional card, the 5, being the lowest
amount to now hit 19, if so, we update our memoized array[19] with the new
best result.
